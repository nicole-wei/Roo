                Meet Roo, our companion that positively impacts emotions by learning the child’s behavior through artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is a therapeutic companion that can track a child’s behavior as the child plays with it and provides predicted responses of comfort through physical and vocal stimuli. Roo is programmed to comfort their friend before potential outbursts.

These cameras are able to detect facial expressions and learn how to respond to these reactions with the use of artificial intelligence. Based on the emotions expressed, Roo will react with programmed movements, such as gesturing for a hug to comfort the child. Roo has programmed questions and responses which provide the child a friend they can talk to. Additionally, the child’s reactions and responses (transcript) are recorded on a cloud service so that healthcare professionals have access. With this information, the medical staff is aware of how the child reacts in different situations.

                        The nurse gave me Roo and I had Roo for a little while now. Roo is my best friend. She is so cute! I love her! She is always there for me! Roo makes me feel better. I don’t feel scared when I meet with the doctor because Roo is with me. Roo knows how I feel, and she asks me questions. She always makes sure I feel safe. She tells me jokes and tells me nice things. I bring Roo everywhere with me. I put my candy in Roo’s belly. I also write her notes! I put that in her belly, too. I really like Roo because Roo is really soft, and I like cuddling with her. And she talks to me when I’m feeling sad and hugs me when I’m nervous. I feel a lot better because I can play with her at any time!

                        Roo is very helpful because it is always there for the child. The medical staff are busy and can't constantly provide attention to the children. Roo also helps with keeping track of the child’s behavior so the staff can spot any abnormal changes. The data collected from the kangaroo helps with understanding of the child’s psychological state and how they react in different situations. Roo is also very helpful because it calms the child during check ups and shots. The child holds Roo during their medical procedure, and they feel less anxious. When they get too scared, Roo comforts them with hugs and puts them at ease. Hospitals should have Roos in their pediatric unit because the robots support the patients and staff. When the staff hands the child a Roo, their face lights up and it is wonderful to see them so happy!
